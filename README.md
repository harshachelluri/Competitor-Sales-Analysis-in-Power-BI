#### **Step 1: Data Preparation and Cleaning**
1. **Import Dataset:** Load the relevant sales data into Power BI.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Address any inconsistencies, null values, and errors within the dataset.
3. **Data Transformation:** Apply necessary transformations, such as changing data types, creating calculated columns, and normalizing values for analysis.
4. **Combine Multiple Tables:** Merge different data sources into a unified dataset to ensure comprehensive analysis.
5. **Explore the Data:** Perform initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure, patterns, and anomalies in the data.

#### **Step 2: Building Key Visualizations**
1. **Sales by Manufacturer:** Visualize the sales performance of Sintec and its competitors, broken down by manufacturer.
2. **Revenue Over Time:** Display revenue trends over time to identify seasonality or growth patterns.
3. **Product Performance:** Analyze the performance of different products to determine which items are driving sales.

#### **Step 3: Enhancing Data Insights**
1. **Date Table Creation:** Develop a Date Table for effective time-based analysis, allowing for better time intelligence calculations.
2. **Slicers and Filters:** Add slicers and filters to enable interactive exploration of the data based on various dimensions (e.g., region, manufacturer, time period).
3. **Bookmarks and Spotlights:** Implement bookmarks and spotlights to highlight specific insights and allow for interactive navigation.
4. **AI Visualizations:** Utilize Power BIâ€™s AI capabilities (e.g., Key Influencers, Decomposition Tree) to uncover hidden patterns and trends in the data.
5. **Drillthrough:** Enable Drillthrough functionality to allow users to explore detailed information at a granular level for deeper insights.
